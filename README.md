# Ad-or-Non-Ad-Prediction-
I'll use data mining methods such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosting Algorithm, Logistic Regression, and others to determine whether or not a picture is an advertising ("ad") or not ("nonad"). I performed feature reduction to considerably reduce the amount of features because I am not conducting any explicit training/test split.
